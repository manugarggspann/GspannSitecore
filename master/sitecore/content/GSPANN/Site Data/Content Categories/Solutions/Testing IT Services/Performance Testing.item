 <p>
                    Our view of performance testing is a little different. We don't believe in leaving this critical phase of engineering until after UAT or as we have seen, in some cases, even after deployment. We strongly believe in helping organizations think about Performance as entry criteria for the solutions as opposed to an exit criterion.

                <p>
                    In this space we have experience working on performance benchmarking, load testing, Stress Testing and Endurance Testing. In the Open Source space we work with JMeter and OpenSTA and on the commercial side we work with Load Runner and NeoLoad
