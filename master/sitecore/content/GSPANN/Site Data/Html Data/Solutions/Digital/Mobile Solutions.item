                        It is estimated that now, the number of connected mobile devices exceeds the number of people on earth. The pace at which we are adopting mobile devices is staggering. And we increasingly prefer using mobile devices to access internet over desktops and laptops. The percentage of web traffic coming from mobile devices has jumped by 50% since 2012, whereas the number of mobile devices increased by only 30%, which shows that people are using mobile devices more than before.
